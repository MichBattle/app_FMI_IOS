# Fondamenti - iOS Application

**Fondamenti** is an iOS application designed to assist users in completing FMI exercises. The application features several buttons, each corresponding to a specific functionality.

## Features

### 1. Congruenze
- **Description**: Solves systems of congruences.
- **User Input**: Coefficients and moduli of two congruences.
- **Process**:
  - Calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) with back substitution.
  - Computes the Least Common Multiple (LCM).
  - Determines the particular solution (C) and the complete solution (S).
- **Output**: Displays the intermediate steps and the final solution.

### 2. RSA
- **Description**: Performs RSA-related computations.
- **User Input**: Exponent, coefficient, and modulus.
- **Process**:
  - Factorizes the conditions into prime factors.
  - Calculates the GCD with back substitution.
  - Determines the particular solution (d), the orbit, and the maximum negative and minimum positive whole solutions.
- **Output**: Displays the intermediate steps and the final result.

### 3. Isomorfismi
- **Description**: Checks for isomorphisms between graphs.
- **User Input**: 2 or 3 graphs, with edges specified in the format `"x1-x2,x1-x3,...xn-xk"`.
- **Process**:
  - Checks for 6 specific obstructions.
  - Prints any obstructions not verified.
  - Maps the bijection.
  - Verifies the morphism.
- **Output**: Displays the intermediate steps and results for each pair of graphs.

### 4. Score
- **Description**: Analyzes graph scores and specific properties.
- **User Input**: Scores in `ascending order` `("v1,v2,...,vn")`. Options to check if the graph is Hamiltonian, 2-connected, disconnected, or a tree via checkboxes.
- **Process**:
  - Checks for 4 specific obstructions.
  - Prints the obstruction preventing the vector from being a graph.
  - Applies the score theorem.
  - Verifies if the graph meets the selected properties (Note: `Manual verification is recommended for greater accuracy`).
- **Output**: Displays the intermediate steps and the final results.

### 5. Tool Modulo
- **Description**: Calculates the modulus of a given coefficient.
- **User Input**: Coefficient and modulus.
- **Process**: 
  - Computes the modulus of the given coefficient, which can be an expression (e.g., power or multiplication).
- **Output**: Displays the result in the form `modulo * x + result`.
