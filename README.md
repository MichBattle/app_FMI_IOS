# Fondamenti - iOS Application

**Fondamenti** is an iOS application designed to assist students in completing exercises for Fundamentals of Mathematics and Computer Science (FMI). The application provides several useful tools for solving congruence problems, performing RSA calculations, verifying graph isomorphisms, analyzing graph scores, and calculating modulus.

## Main Features

- **Congruences**: Solves systems of congruences with intermediate steps displayed.
- **RSA**: Performs RSA-related calculations with factorization and detailed solutions.
- **Isomorphisms**: Verifies graph isomorphisms with obstruction checks and bijection mapping.
- **Score**: Analyzes graph scores and verifies properties such as Hamiltonian, 2-connected, disconnected, and tree.
- **Tool Modulo**: Calculates the modulus of a given coefficient, even if expressed as a power or multiplication.
- **Teoremi**: Displays a list of important theorems
